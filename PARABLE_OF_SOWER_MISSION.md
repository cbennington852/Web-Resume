### The Drug "pyro" from parable of the sower has been discovered, and is causing havoc, agents must find and destroy the 
drug before it causes more damage.


### Introduction
Agents are called to sea tac airport. They meet in a small cramped office room with beige floors and acoustic cork ceilings.

The handler then shows them CCTV footage on a small TV. It is monday at 1pm. 

#### The footage    
In the bottom right of the footage it says "Forks Washington community center".

The footage shows a young disheveled man in the entrance of the community center, piling small wooden chairs 
into a small pile. There is a small canister of gasoline next to him. He pours the gas over the pile of chairs, 
and then lights it on fire. He smiles the second the gasoline catches fire. 

Several other people(2 old people, 1 middle aged man, and a child) gather around him, all staring into the fire. 
All of them are smiling.

*At this point the handler grabs the remote and puts the video on 4x speed.*

The fire spreads past the pile, onto the floor, and starts to consume each of the people in the community center. 
Their smiles do not fade, even when they catch fire. Some of them even start to blissfully laugh white burning to death. 


#### Mission objectives
1. Determine cause of death.
2. Prevent cause of death.
The handler gives the agents the address of the community center(Forks washington community center),
as well as the name of the firestarter(The man was I.D.'d to be Jarnathin Banks).
