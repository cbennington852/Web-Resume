**Explosion Damages Yosemite Valley Dam: Authorities blame Terrorist Attack**

**June 13, 2025 – Yosemite Valley, California**
Local authorities are investigating what they describe as a deliberate act of terrorism after a small explosion caused partial damage to Bing Creek Dam early Thursday morning. The incident led to a deadly shootout, leaving five people dead, including four park rangers and a child.

The dam, located about five miles outside the town of Silver Pines, sustained structural stress to an internal turbine around 2:15 a.m., prompting a controlled overflow into a nearby drainage basin. The explosion triggered an armed confrontation between responding park rangers and the suspected saboteurs. Four rangers were fatally shot during the exchange of gunfire. A young child, whose identity has not been released, was also killed in the crossfire.

The Yosemite County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that two unidentified individuals were seen on surveillance footage near the restricted access road shortly before the explosion. Witnesses described the suspects as two tall white nude males. They reportedly fled the scene in a white van shortly after the gunfight.

The names of the dead rangers are below: 
* Rick Grimes (GSW)
* Elizabeth Homes (Suicide)
* Ranger Chamie (GSW)
* Larry Finch (Major Injures)

“This was a brutal and coordinated attack,” said Sheriff Carla Mendez. “We are treating this as an act of domestic terrorism and are working closely with state and federal partners to track down those responsible. The loss of our rangers, and the tragic death of an innocent child, has shaken our entire community.”

The FBI has taken an active role in the investigation, citing the possible involvement of extremist elements. No group has claimed responsibility. Officials emphasized that emergency protocols prevented wider structural failure at the dam.

Bing Creek Dam, a small hydroelectric installation built in the 1970s, services local agriculture and recreational sites. Engineers from the county’s Water Management Division are currently evaluating the integrity of the structure.

Automated alerts were sent to residents in the area, though no evacuations were ordered. Trails and recreation areas near the dam remain closed until further notice.

Authorities urge anyone with information on the suspects or the white van to contact the Yosemite County tip line.
