# Red Alert

## Hook
Right after a particularly messy operation. The handler calls you to a IHOP at 10pm at night. This might be the normal location, this might be out of the ordinary, either way is fine. He sits you down at the IHOP, you can smell the pancakes on him, maybe even see some crumbs on his shirt. 

He gives you the rundown, the players need to move a small box from one greenbox to another. (See greenboxes).  The handler then takes the players into the parking lot. There's a U-Haul in the IHOP parking lot. 

BANG

A gunshot rings out, the handler collapses, on the other side of the parking lot you see a man in a black hoodie, holding a smoking gun.
