Mind controlled crows chase agents

## Hook
A delta green friendly, Professor Parsons was killed yesterday at his workplace (Oregon state university). His research was primarily into birds. The handler shows the team a grainy poor quality security camera footage of Parsons(tall 60+ white male) being ripped apart by hundreds of crows, who are descending upon him from above. 


## Intro
The agents are all given fake college ids form different universities, and fake pHD's from different universities(they can pick their fake phD), under the guise that they are researchers from the various other colleges trying to investigate this death.

The police have already ruled this out as a suicide, there are no police in the scene. The will arrive around 8pm, after classes have ended, so the campus is mostly empty, with a few people milling about, 

## The Aviary
The aviary is a large open canopy building, with large greenhouse glass windows, and a open roof. The aviary also doubles as a botanical garden, so it is very very pretty to walk around, the place would be very scene if it were not for the blood stains  

### Assistant professor Aki
A younger asian woman, who looks a little on edge, if asked about birds, she will calm down, and happy start babbling about biology.

If prompted about the crows that killed her college she will get sad, and direct you to a blood stain on the floor, as well as a giant
crow nest. 
HP : 8
Biology: 80%
All other stats 50%

### The crow nest
There is a large oak tree towards the side of the aviary, which has many crows, and crow nests in the tree. The agents can feel them watching. You can see a glimmer of something shiny in one of the larger nests.  
##### The Shiny
Cell phones, ID's, a random Grade 1 cursed object.(a small shield pendant.) To get to these, you will have to climb up and grab them. 
If an agent lost an item prior to this, they will find it later. 
One of the id's belongs to professor parsons, and the other id belongs to the handler(roll sanity) there are some other objects, like files, and even a knife.
##### The birds
Some of the birds have red eyes. If you look closely you can see the back of their skull. Their head is hollow. (roll sanitiy)

##### Always watching
The birds are being mind controlled by the tall men, if you give any indication that you are delta green, they will attack the players at once. 


## Professor Parsons office
His office is a mess, and there is a cold cup of coffee, that has been sitting there for some time. As you walk by, you can hear some students whispering about how he died after being F*cked by a crow. 

With a successful search or buracracy roll, the agents can find a small locked locker near the side of the room, in which he has
* Colt 1911
* Shotgun (birdshot)
* Manilla File, containing schematics for hollowing out bird minds, and replacing them with mind control fungus
* Small vials (cursed object grade 3). If drunken the user will be able to talk to birds(both a blessing and a curse)

## Tall Man with bagel
Around 9:30pm (1.5 hrs after arrival) a grey tall man will arrive on campus, wearing a blanket. He is teleporting in, so he will simply appear near the entrance of the building, and walk inside. Maybe the agents catch him walking back from the office, maybe they don't. He has a bagel.

If spotted he will mind control the birds, signalling them to attack the agents. If not spotted, he will retrive the items from the nest, and give the birds a bagel.
