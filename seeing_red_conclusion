    A DVD labeled “Sweatin’ to the Oldies”. Playing the DVD offers a variety of live recorded 1950’s rockabilly sounds, with some kind of static distortion in the video and audio. SIGINT 40% recognizes this as steganography. Decoding that reveals a converted black and white film. The film opens with a title card that displays "Project MIRAGE, Reel 4", followed by a 1943 US NAVY test-card and serial-number. It cuts to a man in a lab coat talking animatedly about the promised stealth applications of “the resonator”, the success of smaller unmanned tests, and the upcoming full-scale test with a live crew. It cuts to footage of a ship at sea, bearing the name USN ELDRIDGE. Seconds later, it vanishes, and then reappears 22 minutes later. The film ends. Watching it in full costs 0/1D4 SAN but provides +2 History and +2 Unnatural
