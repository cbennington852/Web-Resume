            Research Assistant
        </h2>
        <em>Gonzaga University, Daniel Olivares </em>
        <em>January 2024 - August 2024</em>
        <p>
            I work one on one with the professor during the school year, we primarily work on research focusing on human learning and teaching.
        </p>

            Typically Computer Science Students are though of as solitary creatures. Students that do not interact with their peers. Oftentimes schoolwork is designed with this in mind, discouraging collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>This outlook, however is rather discouraging, especially to new computer science students. Our reasearch is into building a tool that facilitates collaboration, and presents challenges to students in fun "gamified" ways, to get students engaged</p>
        <p>Over the past year We build a VScode extension, that allows students to complete challenges, and communicate with classmates, Similar to Leetcode and Piazza, but rolled into the students coding editor </p>
        <b>Technologies used</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS</li>
            <li>NodeJs</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This year I attended and presented at SIRC 2025(Spokane Inter-college Research Conference). The experience was a ton of fun, and I really enjoyed myself. Presenting gave me some insights into my own research, as well was walking about and reading other students papers. </p>
