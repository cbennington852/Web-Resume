    <p>Delta Green is a covert group inside the United States
federal government. Its mission is to investigate,
contain, and conceal unnatural events, because the
unnatural is real and it kills. The world of Delta Green
is like our own, but beyond the edges of reality are
powers that outstrip the human mind’s capacity for
understanding. Sometimes those powers bleed through

into our world and destroy every-
thing they touch.</p>

                Clyde Baughman was an active Delta Green agent from 1967 to 1970, and an

                of a massive heart attack. Delta Green has learned of this and has tasked the nearest

                organization.
